# Learning Objectives

This example is intended as a starting point for Android apps involving 
simple drawing. Its learning objectives are:

- Android application development using Scala
    - Use of Scala primarily as a "better Java" 
      (including mutable state where appropriate)
    - using the Simple Build Tool (sbt) for Scala in conjunction with 
      [pfn's well-maintained plugin](https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin)
    - using IntelliJ IDEA (optional)
- Simple graphical drawing (output-only) in Android
- Basic design patterns
    - Strategy
    - Template Method
